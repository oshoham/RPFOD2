BUGS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing inexplicably takes a long time to write but has no indication of taking a long time
	that is, sometimes I'll try and save a file in editor with objects in it, and then when I load only a few of the objects actually seem to have saved
	however if I wait a while after saving, they all seem to save and load appropriately
	thoughts?

reset button sometimes inexplicably doesn't work in editor
      try making a level, saving it, loading it, and then resetting... rinse and repeat to get the bug to reoccur
Robots are not being properly written to the the level in the editor
       you place them and they don't save
       also their lit up squares don't show up sometimes
Paint Respawn rate is way too high
